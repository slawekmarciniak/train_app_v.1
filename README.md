# Ultran Training App v.1

My target is to build CRUD functionality for training app.

In this project I use:
JS,
React,
Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
React Router,
Data store with React Context & useReducer,
Basic Bootstrap & self made CSS styles.

I started with basic functionality of app, based on class components and props.
Then i upgraded app with adding hooks and creating data store with React Context & useReducer.
In version 2 of my app i will use Redux to create data store.
I would like to compare react native data store functionality with Redux library.
